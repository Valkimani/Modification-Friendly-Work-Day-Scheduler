# Modification-Friendly-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Task

The purpose of this coding assignment is to create and demonstrate how a user can add and save important events for each hour of the day in a Work Day Scheduler.This allows more effective use of time. A CSS and HTML files were provided as stater code. The rest of the code was created to enable the Scheduler to save data. Dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery enable the app to run in the browser.

## Functionality

1. When the user opens the work Scheduler, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. With time-blocks displaying business hours, the user is able to select a time and add text.
3. The time-block also provides a place holder to text and click on the save button.
4. The save button ensure the event is saved in local storage.
5. The event also persists therefore when the screen is refreshed, the event is still visible.
