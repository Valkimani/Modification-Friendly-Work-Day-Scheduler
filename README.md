# Modification-Friendly-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Task

The purpose of this coding assignment is to create and demonstrate how a user can add and save important events for each hour of the day in a Work Day Scheduler.This allows more effective use of time. A CSS and HTML files were provided as stater code. The rest of the code was created to enable the Scheduler to save data. Dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery enable the app to run in the browser.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
